Blocker
=======

- Blocker is a video game meant for 1 - 20 players. In Blocker, players race across abstract geometry to collect orbs while trying to knock each other off the map. 
- The game features weird physics. Each player has their own gravity. A player's gravity will re-orient itself to match whichever surface they landed on last.
- Blocker supports 4 player splitscreen and quite a few players online (tested with up to 20).
- Blocker was built with the Unity3d game engine.
